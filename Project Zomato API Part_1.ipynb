The delicious variety of snacks -paneer tikka, chicken tangdi,pizza,mutton kababs,chiken & fish tikka served was just very good with mocktails. The buffet was there for main course. Chiken, fish and mutton dishes are mouth watering. The ambience of the place enhance the taste with light music there. A good place in all respect for date,meet and a get-together. A open place there with live counter was new thing and was very good. The serve you drinks if you are fond of that and every thing in genuine rate. Pasty, Imarti ,chocolate cupcakes in desserts complete your meal here.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n"
